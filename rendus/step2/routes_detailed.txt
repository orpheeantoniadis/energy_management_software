1) get last measurement of a specifit sensor. Sensor is identified by the couple:
controller ID - sensor ID

route:

/<controller>/<sens_num>/last_measure

<controller> :  Pi_1
		Pi_2
		Pi_3
<sens_num> : 1
	     2 ...

2) process the average of the x last measurements of the sensors in a specific room.
Roomse are identified by romm ID. x muste be a parameter of the request:

/<room_id>/average/<x>

<x> :   1
	2 ...

<room_id> : A505
	    A420 ...

3) get the measurements of a specifi sensor between two dates:

/<controller>/<sens_num>/<date1>/<date2>

<controller> and <sens_num> : same than 1)

<date1> : 2017-11-08 09:45:58
	  2010-01-11 10:25:59
<date2> : same than date1, but must be off course higher than date1
